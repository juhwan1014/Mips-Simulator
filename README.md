# Mips-Simulator

## 1. Project Introduction
This project is a MIPS Simulator task that translates binary input files into single-cycle MIPS by referring to the MIPS green sheet. <br /><br />
'Fetch'     -> using 'fopen', 'fread' to pull out a single line of input binary files. <br />
'Decode'  -> Save the extracted instruction in memory and analyze it according to each type.<br />
'Execute' -> Calculate the ALU value using the analysis results according to the Green sheet. <br />
<br /><br />
## 2. Results
I could get a rough idea of how a microprocessor called MIPS works.<br /><br />

I learned the process and format of what I coded inside the computer.<br /><br />
